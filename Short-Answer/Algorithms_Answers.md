#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)This code has a runtime of O(n). Meaning it will only run n amount of times. 



b)The for loop has a runtime of O(n). The while loop has a runtime of O(log n). So the codes runtimes is O(n log n)


c)The code has a runtime of O(n) since it decreases by 1 till it reaches 0

## Exercise II
function eggbreak
takes parameters n-stories
for story in range(n-stories)
if story greater than or equal to f
eggbreak += 1
else pass
return eggbreak

The code has O(n) time comlexity. It will run till all rooms are done.
